Hi, my name is Neil Finnegan. I am a software engineer at Black Duck Security, working on the product formerly known as Whitehat Security.

This is my personal blog to share some of my projects.

I'm always working on something new and different that drives me to continue learning.
As a software engineer it's always important to have a drive to learn new things. I'm always
keen to understand how things work and how I can build things myself. This attitude and mindset
is not something solely limited to software engineering. When I'm not working on software, I
spend my time working on cars; building up the contents of my toolbox, figuring out how to tackle jobs
with the right tools and the importance of quality tooling. Never shying away from bigger jobs like stripping
down engine and drivetrain parts and putting it back together, even if it's a few months later.

3d printing has become a huge part of my day to day life. It's a amazing tool to add to the repository
of a habitual tinkerer. It's been an absolute game changer for me; being able to conceptualise an idea in your head,
spend a few hours 3d modelling and then bringing that model to life with a 3d printer.

To bring of all this together, I also love working with SOCs and SBCs. A passion I discovered
when I was introduced to the Raspberry Pi, which eventually became the basis of my final year university
project and dissertation.

I have since started getting stuck into the world of ESP32s and this is what pushed me to make this blog
for sharing some of the cool stuff I have been cobbling together in my spare office.
